# DABBLING WITH GOOGLE BLOCKLY

More specifically, dabbling with creating custom blocks, and creating tooling for self learning as well as to complete certain tasks.

## Getting started ðŸŽ¬

A lot of this code will be tutorial follow throughs, or self dabbling and not an entirety of a project. It is more of a dipstick to see how far blockly can go and what I can do with it on a higher level before actually taking up a project, and I'm very excited !

### Prerequisites ðŸ§º

None at the moment.

## Built With ðŸ”¨

* [Blockly](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/blockfactory/index.html) - Used to create blocks. Javascript may (and probably, will) be edited and added to add functionality.

## Author ðŸ“š
